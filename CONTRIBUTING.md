## ðŸ”‘Guidelines

1. Welcome to this repository, if you are here as open source program participant/contributor.
2. Participants / contributors have to **comment** on issues they would like to work on, and mentors or the PA (Project Administrators) will assign you.
3. Not that you **cannot** begin working on a particular issue **without being assigned to by PAs**.
4. Issues will be assigned on a **first-come, first-serve basis.**
5. Please discuss with the team once before opening your issues. We respect all your contributions, whether it is an Issue or a Pull Request.
6. When you **raise a issue**, make sure you get **it assigned to you, before you start working** on that project.
7. Each participant / contributor will be **assigned 1 issue (max)** at a time to work.
8. **One PR** must correspond to **one issue**. A PR resolving **more than one issue** will be deemed invalid.
9. Participants are expected to follow **project guidelines** and [**coding style**](https://pep8.org/"). **Structured code** is one of our top priority.
10. Try to **explain your approach** to solve any issue in the comments. This will increase the chances of you being assigned.
11. Don't create issues that are **already listed**.
12. Please don't pick up an issue already assigned to someone else. Work on the issues after it gets **assigned to you**.
13. Make sure you **discuss issues** before working on the issue.
14. Pull requests will be merged after being **reviewed** by a mentor or PA.
15. It might take **a day or two** to review your pull request. Please have patience and be nice.
16. Always create a pull request from a **branch** other than `main`.
17. Participants / contributors have to complete issues before the decided Deadline. If you fail to make a PR within the deadline, then the issue will be assigned to another person in the queue.
18. While making PRs, don't forget to **add a description** of your work.
19. **Any PR** made by any contributor to resolve **any issue without being assigned to it** will be deemed **invalid**.
20. Include issue number (Fixes:issuenumber) in your commit message while creating a pull request.
21. Make sure your solution to any issue is better in terms of performance and other parameters in comparison to the previous work.
22. We all are here to learn. You are allowed to make mistakes. That's how you learn, right!.
